# website

I have implemented my personal website from scratch, utilizing the SvelteKit web framework. 
The website prioritizes a minimal interface, with design details that I hope emphasize aspects of my personality. 
I have added integration with the Sanity CMS as a backend for blog and project posts, which allows for
an admin interface which enables writing and updating posts without writing code.

	<h1 class="text-5xl/tight line justify-stretch">Hello. My name is Justin Lopato. I am currently doing CS & robotics at Rice University. I enjoy listening to cutting edge music, and having a great time with friends. Recently, I have been spending a lot of time at the Rice Robotics Club, where I am a lead in the CS subteam of R&D. There, I have gained a wealth of knowledge from topics like control systems, simulation, and robotic kinematics/dynamics. To learn more about my endeavors, head to the section of this website labeled <a href="/stuff">stuff</a>.</h1>
